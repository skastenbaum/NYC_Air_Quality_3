            <h2>As NYC braces for the first congestion pricing policy in the U.S., observers watch for a reduction in harmful vehicle emissions. Some neighborhoods could see an increase.</h2>

        <div class="story">
            <p>The new year will usher in sweeping changes for New York’s streets and public transit. Climate activists, transportation experts, and urban planners around the world will pay close attention as
                <a href="https://congestionreliefzone.mta.info/about">the first Congestion Pricing policy in the U.S.</a> is implemented in the nation’s most densely populated city.</p>

            <p>Toll money collected from vehicles entering the city’s business core will serve as the basis for funding mass transit improvements and expansions. The new revenue stream will pay off $15 billion worth of municipal bonds over time, issued to cover the cost of
                <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/putting-commuters-first-keeping-costs-down-governor-hochul-unveils-plans-future-transit-and">a broad range of capital projects.</a>
            </p>

            <p>The policy also aims to decrease air pollution in New York. Our analysis of an ongoing
                <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r/about_data">air quality monitoring program</a>,
                conducted by the city’s health department, revealed that fine particles and nitrogen dioxide air pollution are elevated in the congestion pricing zone.</p>

            <p>Emissions from vehicles that burn fossil fuels are a primary source of these harmful pollutants. They’re
                <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health#:~:text=Short%2Dterm%20exposures%20to%20PM10,air%20pollution%20causes%20lung%20cancer.">associated with respiratory illnesses</a>,
                including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-term exposure is also linked to lung cancer and decreased lung function in children.</p>

            <p>The highest levels of those pollutants were found where traffic jams are common in Manhattan, as seen in the accompanying maps. Vehicles often back up in bottleneck approaches to the Lincoln and Holland tunnels. Similar air quality measurements were also found near the Queens Midtown Tunnel and the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge.</p>

            <p>While the goal is to decrease air pollution in the city’s core, there are concerns about shifting vehicle emissions to other neighborhoods as drivers reroute to avoid the congestion pricing zone.</p>

            <p>“ We do need to reduce emissions across all sectors, but not at the cost of other communities. We cannot create these sacrifice zones,” said Kevin Garcia, Senior Transportation Planner at the
                <a href="https://nyc-eja.org/">New York City Environmental Justice Alliance</a> (NYCEJA). The organization advocates for environmental justice in areas that are disproportionately impacted by polluting infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The South Bronx has some of the highest rates of respiratory illnesses in the U.S. The area is home to the Hunts Point Market, the second largest food distribution facility in the world, drawing more than 15,000 truck trips daily. “ They are some of the dirtiest polluting vehicles on the road,” Garcia said. “Then there is the increased traffic from the unregulated growth of e-commerce warehouses.”</p>

            <p>The NYCEJA and other groups asked for and received mitigation measures from the MTA to address the projected increase in truck traffic in other neighborhoods. “We’ve been able to secure over $100 Million dollars from the MTA [Metropolitan Transportation Authority] and other program sponsors to reduce emissions in the Bronx, and across the entire study area,” Garcia said.</p>

            <p>Congestion pricing tolls go into effect on Jan. 5, 2025. Air quality monitors were installed in neighborhoods where the MTA projected an increase in traffic.</p>
